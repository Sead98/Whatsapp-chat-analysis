# Whatsapp-chat-analysis
This project builds a machine learning–based authorship detection system that predicts which user wrote a given WhatsApp message. Using linguistic, behavioral, and temporal features extracted from chat data, a Logistic Regression classifier is trained to distinguish between users based on how they communicate.

The project demonstrates how classical ML techniques, combined with structured feature engineering, can effectively solve real-world authorship attribution problems
